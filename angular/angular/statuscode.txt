What is http Status Code?
	The server issues an http status code in response to a request of the client made to the server.

	Responses are grouped into five classes:
		Informational response(100-199)- It gives information about the request from client and response from the server.
		Successful response(200-299)- It indicates success of the response
		Redirection response(300-399)-
		Client error response(400-499)- It indicates the fault is from client side.
		Server error response(500-599)-It indicates the fault is from server side.
