what are the ways we have in JavaScript to Display Possibilities?
	JavaScript can display data in different ways:
	By using innerHTML-
		To access an HTML element, javascript can use the document.getElementById(id) method.
		This id attribute defines the HTML element and the content inside the HTML element is the innerHTML.
	By using document.write()-
		It is used for testing purpose.
		Using document.write() after an HTML document is loaded, it will delete all exixting element.
		The document.write() should be used only for testing.
	By using window.alert()
		We can use an alert box to display data.
