what are the Arithmetic operations?
	A typical operation operates on two numbers or more, it may be literals or variables or expressions.
what are Operators and Operands?
	The numbers which are there in operation are called Operands.
	The operation to be performed between two operands are called Operators.
What are the different types of Operators?
	The addition(+) operator adds the numbers.
	The Subtracting(-) operator subtracts the numbers.
	The Multiplication(*) operator multiplies the numbers.
	The division(/) operator divides the numbers.
	The modulus(%)operator shows the division remainder.
	The incremen(++) operator increases the number.
	The decrement(--) operator decreases the number.
	The exponentiation(**) operator raises the first operand as the power of the second operand.
What is an Operator precedence?
	Operator Precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic Operation.
	Example: let x = 100 + 20 * 5;
		As in school mathematics, multiplication is done first because multiplication and division have high precedence.
	When using parenthesis, the operators inside the parenthesis are computed first.
		Example: let x = (100 + 20)*5;
	When many operations have the same precedence like addition and subtraction, then they will computed from left to right.
		Example: let x = 100 + 20 _5
