What are Javascript For Loop?
	If you want to run the same code number of times, each time with different values then use for loop.
What are the different kinds of Loops?
	Javascript supports different kinds of loops:
		-for
		-for/in
		-for/of
		-while
		-do/while
Define For Loop?
	The for loop has the three statements:
	statement 1 : it will execute one time before the execution of code block.
	statement 2 : it defines the condition for executing the code block.
	statement 3 : it will execute every time after the code block is executed.
Define Statement 1?
	You will use statement1 to intialize the variable .
	This is not always a case, Javascript doesnt care, statement 1 is optional.
	You can initiate many values in statement1 separated by comma.
Define Statement 2?
	Statement2 is used to evaluate the condition of the initial variable.
	Statement2 is also optional.
	If statement2 returns true, the loop will starts again, if returns false, the loop will end.
Define Statement 3?
	statement 3 increments the value of the initial variable.
	Statement 3 is also optional.
What is Loop Scope?
	You should use let variable inside the loop, where using var will not give the exact result.
