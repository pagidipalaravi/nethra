What is an Object?
	object is an real time entity, it can be car, empoyee or a book etc.
	Object consists of properties and behaviour.
	We will define Object properties with variables and object behaviour with functions.
Compare objects and variables?
	Objects can be variables too, it means we can call objects as variables.
	But, objects contains many values where as variables contains a single value.
What is Object definition?
	You can define or create a object with object literal.
	It contains many values, values are written as name:value pairs.
In how many ways we can write object properties?
	We can access object properties in two ways:
		- objectName.propertyName
		-objectName["propertyName"]
	but, here always recommended to use the first method only.
What are Object Methods?
	Objects  can also have methods.
	Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
	Methods can be written in the properties as function definitions.
What is "this" keyword?
	if you want to refer current object in the object then use "this" keyword.
	In a function definition, this keyword is the owner of the function.
