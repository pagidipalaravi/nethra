What is Switch Statement?
	Switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
	It is used to select one of many  code blocks to be executed.
How Switch statement works?
	Switch expression is valuated once, the value of expression is compared with value of each case.
	If there is a match, the associated code block will be executed.
	If there is no match, the default code block will be executed.
What is the break Keyword?
	It will terminate execution of current loop or condition and control will comes out of current loop or condition
	When Javascript reaches the break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.
	This will stop the execution inside the switch block.
What happens if we ignore break keyword?
	If we omit the break keyword, it will execute the next case even if the evaluation not matches.
Why we need to use default keyword?
	The default keyword is used to specify the code to run if there is no case match.
What are Common code blocks?
	Sometimes if you want to give same code block to the different switch cases, then use common code blocks.
Give some details about Switching ?
	If multiple cases matches a case value, the first value will be selected.
	If no matching cases are found, then default text will be selected.
	If there is no default text found, then the program continues to the statement after the switch.
