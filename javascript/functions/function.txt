What are Javascript Functions?
	A Javascript Function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
	A Javascript Function is executed when something invokes it.
Define Javascript Function Syntax?
	Javascript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by name, followed by parentheses().
	Function name contains letters, digits, underscores and dollar signs.
How to define Parameters?
	The parentheses may include parameter names separated by comma.
	Function parameters are placed inside the parentheses() in function definition.
	Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.
	Inside the function, the parameters behaves like a local variables.
What is Function Invocation?
	The code inside the function will execute when something invokes or calls the function: 
	When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button).
	When it is invoked it means called  from JavaScript code.
	Automatically (self invoked).
What is Function Return?
	When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
	Functions are often compute a return value, and the return value is "returned" back to the "caller".
Why functions are used?
	Functions are used to reuse the code, it means define the code once, and use it many times.
	You can use the same code many times with different arguments.
What are Local Variables?
	Variables declared inside the function will become the local to the function.
	Local Variables are only be accessed within the function.
	Local variables are created when function starts and deleted when function stops.
	Local variables are only recognized inside the function, variables with same name can be used in different functions.
