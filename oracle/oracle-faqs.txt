A schema is collection of database objects, including logical structures such as tables, views, sequences, stored procedures, synonyms, indexes, clusters, and database links.
A user owns a schema.
A user and a schema have the same name.
The CREATE USER command creates a user. It also automatically creates a schema for that user.
The CREATE SCHEMA command does not create a "schema" as it implies, it just allows you to create multiple tables and views and perform multiple grants in your own schema in a single transaction.
For all intents and purposes you can consider a user to be a schema and a schema to be a user.
Furthermore, a user can access objects in schemas other than their own, if they have permission to do so.
