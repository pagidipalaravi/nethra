HTML Comments Tags
	HTML comments cannot be displayed in the browser, byt they can help document your HTML source code.
	you can add comments to the HTML source code by using the following syntax:
	Syntax
		<!--write your comments here-->
	There is an exclamation point(!) in the start tag and not in the end tag.
	With comments you can make notifications and remainders in HTML code:
	Example
		<!--This is a comment-->
		<p>This is a paragraph</p>
		<!--Remember to add more information here-->
	Comments are also great for debugging HTML, because you can comment out the HTML lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors.
