Nested elements
	Html elements can be nested ( this means that elements can contain other elements).
	All html documents consists of nested HTML elements.

			<head>
				<title>Elements</title>
			</head>
			<body>
				<h1>This is a heading</h1>
				<p>This is a para.</p>
			</body>
		</html>
	Example explained
		The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.
		It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>.
		Then, inside an <html> element there is an <body> element.
		The <body> element defines the document's body.
		It has a start tag <body> and an end tag </body>.
		Then inside a <body> element there are two other elements: <h1> and <p>.
		The <h1> element defines a heading.
		It has a start tag <h1> and an end tag </h1>.
		The <p> element defines a paragraph.
		It has a start tag <p> and an end tag </p>.
Never skip the End Tag
	Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag.
Empty HTML elements
	HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
	The <br> tag defines a line break, with an empty element without a closing tag.
	Example
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html>
			<head>
				<title>Empty HTML elements</title>
			</head>
			<body>
				<p>This is a <br> paragraph with line break.</p>
			</body>
		</html>
HTML is not case sensitive
	HTML tags are not case sensitive: <p> means the same as <p>.
