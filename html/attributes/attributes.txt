HTML attributes
	HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
	All html elements can have attributes.
	Attributes are always specified in the start tag only.
	Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value".
The href attributes
	The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page.
	Example
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html>
			<body>
				<h3>The href attribute<h3>
				<p>The HTML links defines with the tag. The link address is specified in the href attribute:</p>
				<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>
			</body>
		</html>
The src attribute
	The <img> tag is used to embed an image in html page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed.
	Example
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html>
			<body>
				<h2>The src Attribute</h2>
				<p>HTML images are defined with the img tag, and the file name of the image source is specified in the src attribute:</p>
				<img src="img_girl.jpg"> width="500" height="600"
			</body>
		</html> 
The alt attribute
	The alt attribute of an <img> tag specifies an alterante text for an image, if the image for reason cannot displayed.
	This can be due to slow connection, or an error in the src attribute. 
	If we try to display an image that does not exist:
	Example
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html>
			<body>
				<h1>The alt Attribute</h1>
				<p>If we try to display an image that doesnot exist, the value of an alt attribute will be displayed instead.</p>
				<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">
			</body>
		</html>
Absolute URL
	Links to an external image that is hosted on the another website.
	Example
		src="https://www.W3Schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".
Relative URL
	Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here the URL does not include the domain name.
	If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page.
	Example
		src="img_girl.jpg"
	If the URL of an image begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain.
	Example
		src="/image/img_girl.jpg".
The style attribute
	The style attribute is used to add style to an element, such as colour, font, size and more.
	Example
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html>
			<body>
				<h1>The style Attribute</h1>
				<p>The style Attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as colour:</p>
				<p style="color:green;">This is a pink para.</p>
			</body>
		</html>
The lang Attribute
	You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the webpage.
	This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
	Example
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html lang="en">
			<body>
				....
			</body>
		</html>
	Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute.
	Example
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html lang="en-US">
			<body>
				....
			</body>
		</html>
The title attribute
	The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
	Example
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html>
			<body>
				<h1 title="i'm a header">The title Attribute</h1>
				<p title="This is a tooltip">Mouse over this paragraph, to display the title attribute as a tooltip.</p>
			</body>
		</html>
Always use lowercase Attributes
	The Attributes can be written with uppercase or lowercase like  or title, but using lowercase is a better way.
Single or Double Quotes
	Double Quotes around the attributes are the most common in HTML, but Single Quotes can also be used.
	When the attribute value itself contains Double Quotes, then it is necessary to use Single Quotes:
	Example
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html>
			<body>
				<h1>This is a heading</h1>
				<p>Mouse over the paragraph to see the effect.</p>
				<p title="This is a 'title'">title with single quotes</p>
				<p title='This is a "title"'>title with double quotes</p>
			</body>
		</html>
