HTML attributes
	Attributes provide additional information about HTML element.
	All html elements can have attributes.
	Attributes are always specified in the start tag only.
	Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value".
href attributes
	The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page.
	Example:
		<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>
--
src attribute
	The <img> tag is used to embed an image in html page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed.
	Example:
		<img src="img_girl.jpg"> width="500" height="600"
--
alt attribute
	The alt attribute of an <img> tag specifies an alterante text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot displayed.
	This can be due to slow connection, or an error in the src attribute. 
	Example:
		<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">
--
style attribute
	The style attribute is used to add style to an element, such as colour, font, size and more.
	Example:
		<p style="color:green;">This is a pink para.</p>
--
lang Attribute
	You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the webpage.
	This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
	Example:
		<html lang="en"></html>
	Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute.
	Example:
		<html lang="en-US"></html>
--
title attribute
	The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
	Example:
		<h1 title="i'm a header">The title Attribute</h1>
		<p title="This is a tooltip">Mouse over this paragraph, to display the title attribute as a tooltip.</p>
Always use lowercase Attributes
	The Attributes can be written with uppercase or lowercase like title or TITLE, but using lowercase is a better way.
--
Single or Double Quotes
	Double Quotes around the attributes are the most common in HTML, but Single Quotes can also be used.
	When the attribute value itself contains Double Quotes, then it is necessary to use Single Quotes:
	Example:
		<p title="This is a 'title'">title with single quotes</p>
		<p title='This is a "title"'>title with double quotes</p>

What is difference between Absolute URL and Relative URL?
Absolute URL
	Links to an external image that is hosted on the another website.
	Example:
		src="https://www.W3Schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".
Relative URL
	Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here the URL does not include the domain name.
	If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page.
	Example:
		src="img_girl.jpg"
	If the URL of an image begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain.
	Example:
		src="/image/img_girl.jpg".
