HTML Tables
	The HTML table allow web developers to arrange data intlo rows and coloumns.
	A table in HTML consists of table cells inside rows and coloumns.
What is Table Cells?
	Each table cell is defined by <td> and </td> tag, td stands for table data.
	Everything between <td> and </td> are the content of the table cell.
What is Table Rows?
	Each table row starts with <tr> and ends with </tr> tag, tr stands for table row.
	We can make many rows, just makesure that the number of cells are the same in each row.
What is Table Headers?
	If we want to make cells to be headers, in those cases <th> tag has been used instead of <td>.
	By default, the text in <th> tag are centered and bold, but we can change by using CSS.
	Example:
	<body>
		<h2>HTML Table<h2>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>company</th>
				<th>contact</th>
				<th>country</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Ernst Handle</td>
				<td>Roland Mendel</td>
				<td>Austria</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Island Trading</td>
				<td>Helen Bennett</td>
				<td>UK</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Alfreds FutterKiste</td>
				<td>Maria Anders</td>
				<td>Germany</td>
			</tr>
		</table>		
	</body>
How to add a Border for Tables?
	To add a border, use CSS property on table, th, and td element.
	When you want to add border to a table, you can add border around each table cell.
What is Collapsed Table Borders?
	To avoid having double borders, then use the border-collapsed property.
	This will make the borders collapsed into single.
	Example
		table, td, th {
						background-collapse: collapse
					}
What is style Table property?
	If you set a background color of each cell, then give a border a color which is attractive of an invisible border.
	Example
		table {
				border: 2px solid green
				}
Round Table Borders
	To get the round borders, use the border-radius property.
	The border-radius property used to get rounder corners of a border.
	Example
		table {
			border-radius: 5px
			}
	You can skip the table border by leaving out the table from the CSS selector.
HTML Table Sizes
	HTML Tables can have different sizes for each coloumn, row and an entire table.
	Use the style attribute to specify the size of a coloumn, row and a table.
HTML Table Width
	To change the width of a table, add the style attribute with width to a table element.
	Example
		<table style="width: 50%">
HTML Table Coloumn Width
	To set the size of a specific coloumn, add style attribute on <th> or <td>.
	Example

HTML Table Row Height
	To set the height of a specific row add the style attribute on a table row element.
	Example

Vertical Table Headers
	To use the first coloumn as a table header, then define the first cell in each row with <th>.
	Example
		<tr>
			<th>First Name</th>
			<td>jill</td>
			<td>Eve</td>
		</tr>
Align Table Headers
	By default, the table headers are bold and centered.
	If you want to align table headers as left or right, use text-align property.
	Example
			th {
		text-align: left;
		}
Header for Multiple Coloumns
	You can have header that spans over two or more coloumns.
	To do this, use colspan attribute on <th> tag.

	To add a caption to a table, use caption tag.
	Example
		<caption>Tables</caption>
HTML Table-Cell Padding
	Cell padding is space between the cell edges and the cell content. By default, the padding is set to 0.
	To add padding on table cells, use pading property.
	If you want to add padding only above the content, use padding-top property and same for padding-bottom, padding-right, padding-left.
HTML Table-cell spacing
	Cell spacing is space between the each cell. By default it will take 2px.
	To change the space between the cells, use border-space property.

		border-spacing: 20px;
		}
HTML Table-Rowspan
	To make a cell span over multiple rows, use rowspan attribute.
Horizontal Dividers 
	If you want to specify borders only at the bottom of each row, use border-bottom property in tr elements to get horizontal dividers.
Hoverable Table
	Use the hover selector on tr to highlight table rows, when you mouse over the rows.
	Example
		tr:hover {
		background-color: orange;
		}
HTML Table Colgroup
	The <colgroup> element should be used as a container for the column specifications.
	Each group are specified with a <col> element.
	The span attribute specifies how many columns wants to be style.
	The style attribute specifies the style to give the columns.
Multiple Col Elements
	If you want to style more columns with different styles, use more <col> elements inside the <colgroup>.
Empty Colgroups
	If you want to style columns in the middle of a table, insert a "empty" <col> element  for the columns before you want to style.
Hide Columns
	If you want to hide coloumns then use visibility: collapse property.
